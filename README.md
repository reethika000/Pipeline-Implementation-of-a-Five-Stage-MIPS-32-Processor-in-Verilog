# Pipeline-Implementation-of-a-Five-Stage-MIPS-32-Processor-in-Verilog


---

## Project Overview
This project implements a **MIPS32 processor** in **Verilog** using a classic **5-stage pipeline**.  
The design is based on a subset of the **MIPS32 ISA** and demonstrates how instruction pipelining improves throughput while maintaining correct execution semantics.

The processor supports the following stages:  
- **Instruction Fetch (IF)**  
- **Instruction Decode (ID)**  
- **Execution (EX)**  
- **Memory Access (MEM)**  
- **Write Back (WB)**  

---

## Features
- **32 general-purpose registers (`R0–R31`)**, each **32-bit**  
- **R0 hardwired to 0** (cannot be modified)  
- **Word-addressable memory model** (32-bit words)  
- **Subset of MIPS32 ISA implemented**:  
  - **Arithmetic/Logic**: `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `AND`, `OR`, `SLT`  
  - **Immediate Arithmetic**: `ADDI`, `SUBI`, `SLTI`  
  - **Memory Access**: `LW`, `SW`  
  - **Branches**: `BEQZ`, `BNEQZ`  
  - **Special**: `HALT`  
- **Pipeline registers**: **IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB**  
- **Basic hazard handling**: stopping writes after **HALT** or discarding instructions after a **branch taken**

## Instruction Encoding
MIPS instructions are **32 bits wide**. Two formats are used in this project:  
- **R-type**: opcode (6 bits), rs (5 bits), rt (5 bits), rd (5 bits), unused (11 bits)  
- **I-type**: opcode (6 bits), rs (5 bits), rt (5 bits), immediate (16 bits)

## Pipelined Processor Datapath
The datapath is implemented with **pipeline registers** between each stage.

## Hazards Considered
- **Structural hazards**: avoided by separating **instruction memory** and **data memory**  
- **Data hazards**: not fully resolved in hardware; test programs may require inserting **NOPs**  
- **Control hazards**: incorrectly fetched instructions are discarded if a **branch is taken**  

---

## Test Program
The following program was tested to validate arithmetic, logic, branch, and halt instructions.  
It was loaded into the **instruction memory (`instr_mem.mem`)**.  

```asm
20010005   // addi $1, $0, 5        -> $1 = 5
2002000A   // addi $2, $0, 10       -> $2 = 10
00221820   // add  $3, $1, $2       -> $3 = 15
00622022   // sub  $4, $3, $2       -> $4 = 5
00222824   // and  $5, $1, $2       -> $5 = 0
00223025   // or   $6, $1, $2       -> $6 = 15
10220002   // beq  $1, $2, skip     -> not taken
20070064   // addi $7, $0, 100      -> $7 = 100
FC000000   // halt                  -> stop execution
```

**Expected Results**  
- **$1 = 5**  
- **$2 = 10**  
- **$3 = 15**  
- **$4 = 5**  
- **$5 = 0**  
- **$6 = 15**  
- **$7 = 100** (since branch was not taken)  

Execution stops at the **HALT** instruction.
